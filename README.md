Hello there!
I am Antonio Vázquez Araújo.
I am working in this little "operating system" for devices like "L8 The Soundless Speaker"
The idea is to work from a tablet or a mobile and to see the result in the 
L8 screen.
The basic question is: "What we can do with only 8 pixels".
Do you know the Mario Bros version in 8x8 pixels?
What kind of programs can work in this type of devices?
I am working in a component system with windows, buttons, text, scrollers and more.
Using the same scheme of Java Swing, but over-simplifyng it. Is funny.
I need to offer an API to programmers work with.
The type of programs that I dream to have are things like:
Games:
- PacMan
- Invaders
- Chess (think a moment!)
- Snake (obviously)
- Mario Bros (obviously)
- etc, etc
Tools:
- Alarm
- Clock
- Message system
- Paint :-;
- Musical instruments
- Record sound
  etc...
  PUT YOUR IDEA HERE!

Cheers from Spain.
Antonio.
