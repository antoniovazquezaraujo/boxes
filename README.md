Boxes

Boxes at 8x8 pixels. A little "operating system" to work at m√≠nimum.
Boxes is a minimalist graphic framework with Buttons, Switches, Spinners, etc. 
that you can drag, clic, move, and use like the real components, with an API to
write applications.
Boxes runs, with the same codebase in desktop and in android, and I am working
in an IOS version (very easy, because LibGDX provides that).
Boxes uses LibGDX, a very good portable graphic library at libgdx.badlogicgames.com/
You can see a video explaining the basics (sorry for the english :-D ) of an old version, writed in Processing in
youtube, at http://youtu.be/RGyqfp_5J_0
The actual version is all in java, as an eclipse project.
If you are interested in my work and want to help, contact me at
