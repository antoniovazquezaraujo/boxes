A little \"operating system\" to work at mínimum.\r\nBoxes is a minimalist graphic framework with Buttons, Switches, Spinners, etc. \r\nthat you can drag, clic, move, and use like the real components, with an API to\r\nwrite applications.\r\nBoxes runs, with the same codebase in desktop and in android, and I am working\r\nin an IOS version (very easy, because LibGDX provides that).\r\nBoxes uses LibGDX, a very good portable graphic library at libgdx.badlogicgames.com/\r\nYou can see a video explaining the basics (sorry for the english :-D ) of an old version, writed in Processing in\r\nyoutube, at http://youtu.be/RGyqfp_5J_0\r\nThe actual version is all in java, as an eclipse project.\r\nIf you are interested in my work and want to help, contact me at\r\nantoniovazquezaraujo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nAntonio.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
